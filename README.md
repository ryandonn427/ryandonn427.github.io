# Ryan Donnelly Data Science Projects

<ul>
  <li>[MLB Project](https://github.com/ryandonn427/MLB_Proj/)
  <ol>
    <li>Started by figuring out the json data is structured inside the MLB API</li>  
    <li>After I structured all the GETs, I started creating the POSTGRESQL table structures</li>
    <li>The game_ids were not in a specific order, so I created a bot to get the sequential game_ids</li>
    <li>After that, I inserted all the data and applied indexes</li>
  </ol>
  ### Notes
  This was made a while ago so not everything was coded efficiently. If I had to recreate this, I would have took advantage of using pandas for a lot of these arduous tasks.
